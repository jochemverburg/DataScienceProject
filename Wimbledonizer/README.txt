This folder contains the project for the topics Semantic Web & Natural Language Processing made by Floris Smit and Jochem Verburg.

Not all java-classes are completely documented, but they should be usable by using the report handed in. Some of the file-names in mains should be edited to match the files in this folder.

The results-folder contains some of the results gotten by using the REAnalyzer. It also contains the developed ontologies. The resources-folder contains the used resources, except for the Wimbledon-tweetset since this is a very large file already available on BlackBoard.
